## Background

CVD disease (CVD) is one of the most serious health issues and leading cause of sudden death in the worldwide. 
It is a common issue in both developed countries and developing countries. 
Risk factors for the CVD basically categorize demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, environmental, and physiological factors. But there may be some other factors that matter.
There for it is very important to gather and analyze CVD death information  to make any decision on minimizing CVD death rates.

## Scope of the project 
 
In this project analysis is limited to the counties only in Unites Sates of America (USA).
Further analysis is limited to the demographic risk factor among various risk factors associated with the CVD death rate. 

## Data source
1. catalog.data.gov
2. lung.org/research

## Area of analysis
1.	Geographic distribution of the CVD death rate.
2.	Effect of the smoking behavior to the CVD death rate  
3.	Distribution of Heart disease among ethnicities.
4.  Distribution of Heart disease among gender groups.

## Folder structure
1.	All the source code file (jupyter notebook) available at the root level.
2.	Resources folder: This folder contains all the resources data file. 
3.	Project Proposal : This folder contain the project proposal.
4. Outputs : This folder contains all the graphs. 
5. Summary : final presentation with the conclusion.
